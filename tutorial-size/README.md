Crystallite Size Distribution (CSD) and minor phase fraction refinement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial illistrates refinement of CSD in a nanocrystalline anatase powder
containing a bit of additional TiO2 component that is assumed to be very fine
nanocrystalline brookite.

 - The measurment should have excelent statistical quality.
 - It was done by a very standard laboratory powder diffractometer.
   Using Bragg-Brentano geometry with variable slits.
   Try to find where it is indicated.
 - Instrumental function is included.
 - Crystal structures are already available in structures.xml file
   (one directory up, do not forget to adjust pathes in the imp file or
    copy file to the given directory)
 - Try to play with anatase size distribution parameters.
 - Watch also minor component fraction.
 - Try if anatase structure parameters can influence the resuts.
 - Look on lattice parameters and compare with literature.
   Look also for nanocrystalline samples data.
 - You have 2 samples that were calcinated at different temperatures
   (300 degC and 380 degC).
