Crystallite Size Distribution (CSD) and phase fraction of a minot comment

This tutorial illistrates refinement of CSD of a nanocrystalline anatase powder containing a bit of additional TiO2 component that is assumed to be
very small crystalline brookite.

Instrumental function is included.
Crystal structures are already available in structures.xml file.
The measurment should have excelent quality.
It was done by a very standard laboratory powder diffractometer.
Using Bragg-Brentano geometry with variable slits.
Try to play with anatase size distribution parameters.
Watch also minor component fraction.
Try if anatase structure parameters can influence the resuts.
Look on lattice parameters and compare with literature. Look also for nanocrystalline samples data.
You have 2 samples that were calcinated at different temperatures (300 degC and 380 degC).
